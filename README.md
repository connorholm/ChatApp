# ChatApp
A python based chat application that lets you communicate through the terminal. Inspired from a project made in Java. [Previous Project](https://github.com/ralster213/CyberSecurity/tree/master/GroupChat)

##Logic
As a user sends a message, it goes to the server. Once the server recieves the message it distributes it out to the other clients. This type of logic forms a usable local chat system.
